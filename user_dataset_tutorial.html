<p>When there are no datasets, genomic sites show this description with some links:</p>

After someone successfully went to Galaxy, did stuff there, and came back, it’s assumed they know what they’re doing.</p>
<p>In MBio I originally made it short:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4r2Qzl1.png" alt="mbio no datasets"><br>
so that the users go to the “new upload” and learn about the three tabs in the ribbon.</p>
<p>There’s some help under the question mark and the text underneath:<br>

But it’s not really enough or good.</p>
<h2 id="option-1-add-it-how-its-on-the-genomic-sites">Option 1: add it how it’s on the genomic sites</h2>
<p>I thought it might be confusing to have lots of content on an empty “All data sets” with also the three tabs, because you can’t navigate back to it. But maybe it’s okay.</p>
<h2 id="option-2-another-tab">Option 2: another tab</h2>
<p>It would look like this:<br>

<p>And it would still be available later:<br>
