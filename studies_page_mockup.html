      <h1 id="adding-rnaseq-data-to-wormbase-parasite">Adding RNASeq data to WormBase ParaSite</h1>
<h2 id="about-this-document">About this document</h2>
<p>I am trying to provide specification for the first release of this functionality. Everything not here will not be a requirement and out of scope until we decide to add it. As specification, it is intentionally opinionated for the sake of completeness and so that it’s easy to discuss. Tell me what the document is wrong about and what it’s missing!</p>
<p>Expression Atlas had to solve the same problem and I refer to their choices a lot, especially when I think we should diverge.</p>
<h2 id="intention">Intention</h2>
<p>Add a scaled down and customised Expression Atlas, in its selected capabilities, to WormBase ParaSite.<br>
We want to deliver:</p>
<ul>
<li>we rely on RNASeq-er to map and quantify reads</li>
<li>curated RNASeq studies from ENA are processed and presented</li>
<li>for each study, show <em>all results from this study</em></li>
<li>for each gene, show <em>everything we have for the gene</em></li>
<li>consistency with the rest of WormBase ParaSite</li>
</ul>
<p>We do not intend to deliver:</p>
<ul>
<li><s>ability to aggregate data for groups of genes</s></li>
<li><s>ability to search by biological condition</s></li>
<li><s>consistency with other EBI resources</s></li>
<li><s>ability to see results broken down by transcript</s></li>
<li><s>good support for organisms with as many studies as C. elegans</s></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="data-we-can-offer">Data we can offer</h2>
<p>We should use the underlying data from RNASeq-er. They offer counts, FPKM, and TPMs from Kallisto and htseq2 quantification programs.</p>
<h3 id="assay-vs-run">Assay vs run</h3>
<pre><code>"run" corresponds to one .bam file
"assay" is a group of runs
"study" is a group of runs too - but in a study, we divide runs into assays
"contrast" is a comparison of two assays
</code></pre>
<p>RNASeq-er analyses runs. Expression Atlas - or us - need to provide metadata so that different runs are grouped into assays as replicates. Insights from the study come from comparing assays with each other.</p>
<h3 id="options">Options</h3>
<h4 id="normalized-expression">Normalized expression</h4>
<p>We should provide this as TPMs from htseq2, aggregated by assay - choose median value among replicates for each assay.<br>
Expression Atlas also accounts for technical replicates and quantile normalizes the data, but we don’t intend to.</p>
<h4 id="raw-counts">Raw counts</h4>
<p>This is just quantification data (counts per gene) in a convenient file. I am not yet sure what the format of this convenient file should be.</p>
<h4 id="differential-expression">Differential expression</h4>
<p>DESeq2: annotate each sample such that they group into assays. DESeq2 will fit a distribution to the data, and then for each two assays - a <em>contrast</em> it can report how much they differ.<br>
Expression Atlas always has clear contrasts - reference vs. test. We don’t mind designs where there is no clear test and reference, more complicated designs, e.g. multiple strains, multiple drug treatments - quantify the variation only due to strain, and only due to drug treatment.</p>
<h4 id="no-expression-evidence-vs.-expression-found-somewhere">no expression evidence vs. expression found somewhere</h4>
<p>Some studies can only be used for this. This is frequently a valuable insight for our data, and we will use it where available.</p>
<h3 id="what-to-choose">What to choose</h3>
<p>Quantification and raw counts should always be available. Differential expression should be available for whatever contrasts we choose, and comparing all assays against all assays is will be a default and frequently sensible choice.</p>
<p>The Expression Atlas notion of baseline and differential experiments as distinct is not suitable for us. We want to be able to do different analyses where we think it’s sensible.</p>
<h2 id="studies-page">Studies page</h2>
<p>Current WormBase ParaSite species page should link to a page with a list of RNASeq studies, where available. All studies for a species should appear on the page in some intentional order, possibly as one long list.<br>
We expect at most ten studies per species in the first release of the functionality, and never have more than fifty in the foreseeable future. We will import no more than a fraction of available <em>C. elegans</em> data, and giving it coverage will never be our major focus.</p>
<h3 id="example-studies---s.-mansoni">Example studies - <em>S. mansoni</em></h3>
<p><em>Imagine the below as one long list, listing all S. mansoni studies we processed. For each study it is clear where we took it from, what the authors said it was, and how we curated and analyzed it. More of this information is available when requested. User can browse through and read the descriptions, and either download data as TSV files or view them in a simple webpage, opened in separate browser tab.</em></p>

<h4 id="question-marks-about-ui">Question marks about UI</h4>
<p>The following information is available, but I’m not sure whether and how to include:</p>
<ul>
<li>data provider</li>
<li>number of runs</li>
<li>links to study page</li>
</ul>
<p>“Show all” intends to lead to experiment design, which would list various properties of the runs in the study and how they’re grouped into assays. I don’t know how to design this better now.</p>
<h2 id="the-need-for-more-than-just-studies-pages">The need for more than just studies pages</h2>
<p>It is very simple to provide only the above functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>data can be provided as files on the FTP server</li>
<li>webpage per species describing the studies and linking to these files - this can even be written and corrected manually</li>
</ul>
<p>We believe listing studies and analyzing them is not valuable enough - the study authors already analyze their data, better than we can do.</p>
<h2 id="one-idea-analyze-data-on-demand">One idea: analyze data on demand</h2>
<p>The idea was to offer information about studies, and then let the user interact with it: change how runs are grouped into assays, select analyses to be done, and wait for results.</p>
<h3 id="why-not">Why not</h3>
<ul>
<li>The user won’t know what to select unless we curate the metadata</li>
<li>I don’t foresee many analysis options, so there is not much value in providing capability to do them dynamically</li>
<li>It is very valuable for the user to be able choose a gene and then see data for this gene from different studies</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-it-appealed-to-me-for-a-while">Why it appealed to me for a while</h3>
<ul>
<li>still quite simple - no need for a database storing individual results</li>
<li>no capability to search by gene could be excused if users are “digging out” the data themselves</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="gene-pages">Gene pages</h2>
<p>Gene pages make this into a much more challenging software project.<br>
With searching by gene the system needs to understand what the studies are, how to extract the data for each gene, and how to present it.<br>
We think it’s very important to let the user look at a gene of interest, and see the results for this gene in various studies.</p>
<p>The gene pages will</p>
<h3 id="data-we-can-offer-per-gene">Data we can offer per gene</h3>
<p>The analyses will yield:</p>
<ul>
<li>expression level for each assay</li>
<li>fold change and some measure of certainty like p-value  for each contrast</li>
</ul>
<p>We will have uniform criteria for when we consider data points significant or not:</p>
<ul>
<li>expression of at least 0.5 TPM in some assay to be significant in the study</li>
<li>p. value &lt; 0.05 or similar to be significant in the contrast</li>
</ul>
<p>We will present significant results first.</p>
<pre><code>This needs discussion. A notion of attaching significance to results helps with querying BioMart.
</code></pre>
<h4 id="question-marks">Question marks</h4>
<p>The data could carry a notion of whether it is significant or not?</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-jbrowse">Integration with JBrowse</h2>
<p>When consuming per-gene information, it is essential that the user is able to verify data by looking at more basic data it was inferred from. We currently present this in the genome browser. It is valuable to</p>
<p>Gene pages ca</p>
<h2 id="integration-with-biomart">Integration with BioMart</h2>
<p>We believe providing queries based on expression values in BioMart is of very limited value. Motivated users will analyze study results in detail after downloading data from us, but it is infeasible to allow them to do so through the  BioMart interface: complex queries that can be interesting vary per study and BioMart doesn’t allow this.</p>
<p>We only intend to support queries that are not specific to individual studies. The initial release should support these queries:</p>
<ul>
<li>is there expression for gene anywhere?</li>
<li>is there significant expression data for study Y?</li>
<li>is there significant expression data for contrast X in study Y?</li>
</ul>
<p>We intend to</p>
<h2 id="miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</h2>
<h4 id="how-much-work-will-it-take">How much work will it take?</h4>
<p>We expect at least half a year of active development, before minimal viable functionality, and that many people will be involved in the work and its different aspects.</p>
<h4 id="can-we-analyze-data-between-the-studies-in-a-meta-analysis-and-say-as-wormbase-what-we-think-the-expression-is">Can we analyze data between the studies in a meta-analysis and say as WormBase what we think the expression is?</h4>
<p>Provenance of information is important to us but usually we provide a single answer to a question - e.g. we say with confidence where the repeats are in the genome calculating them with the best tool available, and provide a single gene description quoting e.g. UniProt on this description.<br>
We believe it is fundamentally impossible to do so with expression data. We can pool runs from different studies and apply normalization techniques (Compare: <em>Lu et al, 2018</em>) but this will create another study among many, perhaps to be featured as valuable.</p>
