## Intention
We will add a scaled down and customised Expression Atlas, in its selected capabilities, to WormBase ParaSite.
We want to achieve:
- a workflow to import alignment and quantification data from RNASeq-er
- a process importing quantification data from RNASeq-er and performing analyses specified during curation
- for each study, our site can show *all results from this study*
- for each gene, our site can show *everything we have for the gene*
- consistency with the rest of WormBase ParaSite
   + link to aligned reads in genome browser
   + basic querying and bulk export through BioMart

In this project, we do not intend to deliver:
- ~~ability to aggregate data for groups of genes~~
- ~~ability to search by biological condition~~
- ~~consistency with other EBI resources~~
- ~~ability to see results broken down by transcript~~
- ~~good support for organisms with as many studies as C. elegans~~
- ~~data displayable in the genome browser~~


## Data we can offer
We should use the underlying data from RNASeq-er. They offer counts, FPKM, and TPMs from Kallisto and htseq2 quantification programs.
### Assay vs run
> Assay is not the best word, because it also has a wet lab meaning.
> I'm searching for a better one!
> Expression Atlas calls a group of runs an "Assay group" and calls ENA runs "assays" which is not what I mean.
```
"run" corresponds to one .bam file
"assay" is a group of runs
"study" is a group of runs too - but in a study, we divide runs into assays
"contrast" is a comparison of two assays
```
RNASeq-er analyses runs. Expression Atlas - or us - need to provide metadata so that different runs are grouped into assays as replicates. Insights from the study come from comparing results between the assays.
### Analyses available
#### Normalized expression
We should provide this as TPMs from htseq2, aggregated by assay - choose median value among replicates for each assay.
Expression Atlas also accounts for technical replicates and quantile normalizes the data, but we don't intend to.
#### Raw counts
This is just quantification data (counts per gene) in a convenient file.
>  I am not yet sure what the format of this convenient file should be.
#### Differential expression
DESeq2: annotate each sample such that they group into assays. DESeq2 will fit a distribution to the data, and then for each two assays - a *contrast*- it can report how much they differ.
Expression Atlas always has clear contrasts - reference vs. test. We don't mind designs where there is no clear test and reference, and we are open to more complicated designs, e.g. a design with multiple strains and multiple drug treatments, where we may quantify the variation only due to strain, and only due to drug treatment.
#### no expression evidence vs. expression found somewhere
Some studies can only be used as a "yes or no" measure of expression. This is frequently a valuable insight for our data, and we will use this analysis where nothing else is available.
### What analyses for what studies
Normalized expression and raw counts should always be available. Differential expression will be available for whatever contrasts are created - and comparing all assays against all assays will be a default and frequently sensible choice. 

The Expression Atlas notion of baseline and differential experiments as distinct is not suitable for us. We want to be able to do different analyses where we think is sensible.

## Studies page
Current WormBase ParaSite species page should link to a page with a list of RNASeq studies, where available. All studies for a species should appear on the page in some intentional order, possibly as one long list.
We expect at most ten studies per species in the first release of the functionality, and never have more than fifty in the foreseeable future. We will import no more than a fraction of available *C. elegans* data, and giving it coverage will never be our major focus.


### Example studies - *S. mansoni*
*Imagine the below as one long list, listing all S. mansoni studies we processed. For each study it is clear where we took it from, what the authors said it was, and how we curated and analyzed it. More of this information is available when requested. User can browse through and read the descriptions, and either download data as TSV files or view them in a simple webpage, opened in separate browser tab.*

#### SRP071241: *Comparison of gene expression between female Schistosoma mansoni heads and tails* ([Wang and Collins, 2016]())
##### comparing by organism part: head vs tail
adult, female ([show all]())
| [DESeq2]() | [counts]() | [aggregated expression (TPM)]()| 
|--|--|--|

```
Typical differential experiment:
 - something weird done to the animal
 - very specific conditions that facilitated the above
 - expression with and without the weird thing
```
#### SRP017443: *Adult somatic stem cells in the human parasite Schistosoma mansoni*
##### comparing by irradiation: '200Gy' vs none

```
This is a typical baseline experiment:
 - attempt to create "normal" conditions for the animal
 - tries to find genes specific to aspects of the animal's biology
```
#### E-MTAB-451:  *RNA-Seq of Schistosoma mansoni (flatworms) larva and adult individuals at different life-stages*

Many assays, and the dataset can be interrogated in many ways.
Challenging for us to support, but it's very important that we are able to.

> #### Question marks about UI 
> The following information is available, but I'm not sure whether and how to include:
> - data provider
> - number of runs
> - links to study page 
>
> "Show all" intends to lead to experiment design, which would list various properties of the runs in the study and how they're grouped into assays. I don't know how to design this better now.


## The need for more than just studies pages
It is very simple to provide only the studies pages: data can be provided as files on the FTP server, and a webpage per species describing the studies and linking to these files can even be written manually.

We believe curating the studies, analyzing them, and posting the results is not valuable enough by itself - the study authors already analyze their data better than we can do generically. 


> ## One idea: analyze data on demand 
> The idea was to offer information about studies, and then let the user interact with it: change how runs
> are grouped into assays, select analyses to be done, and wait for
> results.
> ### Why not
> - The user won't know what to select unless we curate the metadata well
> - I don't foresee many analysis options, so there is not much value in providing capability to do them dynamically
> - It is very valuable for the user to be able choose a gene and then see data for this gene from different studies
> ### Why it appealed to me for a while
> - still quite simple - no need for a database storing individual results
> - no capability to search by gene could be excused if users are "digging out" the data themselves


## Gene pages
Gene pages make this into a much more challenging software project.
With searching by gene the system needs to understand what the studies are, how to extract the data for each gene, and how to present it.
We think it's very important to let a user see results for a gene of interest across all studies.


### Data we can offer per gene
The analyses will yield:
- expression level for each assay
- fold change and some measure of certainty like p-value  for each contrast

We will present significant results first.

We will have uniform criteria for when we consider data points significant or not:
- expression of at least 0.5 TPM in some assay to be significant in the study
- p. value < 0.05 and at least two-fold change or similar to be significant in the contrast

> A notion of attaching significance to results helps with querying BioMart. I feel the idea needs discussing though: is it meaningful to for us to say that a result is significant or not significant based on a threshold ?


### Visualization
We will prioritize clarity, which we will first attempt to achieve with simple data representations like a two column table. We also have the following graphical representations in mind.

#### Expression per assay 
We consider a bar chart: different assays on one axis, expression on another.

#### Contrasts
This could be represented as a square matrix with assays in both rows and columns, cell representing a contrast, and cell color representing fold change.

## Integration with JBrowse
When consuming per-gene information, it is essential that the user is able to verify data by looking at more basic data it was inferred from. We currently present such data in Ensembl's genome browser and in JBrowse, and we will link to JBrowse.

Specially crafted link for each study will lead from a gene page into a JBrowse display with correct data open. This is worthwhile despite the limitations of JBrowse where no more than 30 runs are allowed, and many fewer runs fit on the screen at one time.

## Integration with BioMart
We believe providing queries based on expression values in BioMart is of very limited value. Motivated users will analyze study results in detail after downloading the data from us, but it is infeasible to allow them to do so through the BioMart interface: complex queries that can be interesting vary per study and BioMart doesn't allow this.

We only intend to support queries that are not specific to individual studies. The initial release should support these queries:
- is there expression for gene anywhere? 
- is there significant expression data for at least one of the chosen studies? (user multi-selects a study)
- is there significant enrichment in at least one of the chosen contrasts? (user multi-selects a contrast)

We will support export of expression data through BioMart in tabular form.

## Miscellaneous
#### How much work will it take?
We expect at least half a year of development before the project delivers all functionality as described here and integrated into the main WormBase ParaSite portal.
The project involves a variety of roles and we expect that multiple people will be involved in the work.

#### Can we analyze data between the studies in a meta-analysis and say as WormBase what we think the expression is?
Provenance of information is important to us across our resource. Usually we provide a single answer to a question - e.g. we say with confidence where the repeats are in the genome, calculating them with the best tool available to us. We pool available sources and provide a single description for a gene, referencing e.g. UniProt while saying that `Smp_144070` is a `putative gastric mucin`. 
We believe it is fundamentally impossible to do so with expression data. We can pool runs from different studies and apply normalization techniques (Compare: *Lu & Berriman, 2018*) but this will create another study among many, perhaps one that is considered valuable and prominently featured.
#### Is this only for expression data?
No, but this is essential about expression data here:
- Study captures an organism in a few carefully controlled states 
- Each of these states generates data per gene
- Insights come from comparing per-gene results, to link the difference in experimental conditions with gene function
- The users mostly browse through analysis results, or look at results across analyses for a chosen gene

#### What limitations are we comfortable with?
The solution will be most suited for a small number of studies with not too much analyzed data per species. In the proposed design, all species will all be listed on one page. We can have no more than perhaps fifty studies per species if the page is to stay clear, navigable, and load smoothly.

The studies may only have modest amounts of processed data because we do not plan dedicated infrastructure for this project. We will budget one megabyte per assay in a core species database, and half a megabyte per assay in BioMart.

#### Is this only for WormBase ParaSite?
Plant and mosquito communities are in a similar position of having many available genomes with modest amount of functional genomics data per species. The work will stay generic enough to e.g. be easily adapted to a new Ensembl website in 2020, and to be adaptable throughout the lifetime of WormBase ParaSite.
